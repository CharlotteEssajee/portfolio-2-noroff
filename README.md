# Portfolio 2
As a developer, you will have to maintain a level of professionalism. This extends past writing code. We need to document our apps so that other developers can run the code without any issues. We also need to keep a professional-looking portfolio so that others have confidence in us and the work that we do.


## Brief
In this assignment, you will be documenting three prior submissions from the first year:
Semester Project 2
JavaScript Frameworks CA
Project Exam 2
You will be creating a README.md file at the root of each of these projects and then documenting the submissions following a given format.

You will then also be creating a README.md for your own personal GitHub profile.

Lastly, you will be creating a portfolio webpage that lists these 3 projects.

This page must:
- List the 3 projects as cards
- Each card must have:
the title of the project,
a description,
a screenshot of how the project looks when running,
a link to the GitHub repo and a live site if it is online.
